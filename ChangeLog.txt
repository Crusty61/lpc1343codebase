v0.32 - In Progress
===================

- Moved command.c and cmd_tbl.h to /project to try to keep all 
  project-specific files in one location to improve code-sharing and make
  upgrading easier
- Created seperate .c files for every command for the command-line interface
  to make it easier to maintain and share code between projects.  All commands
  listed in cmd_tbl.h are now stored in their own files in /project/commands 
  (ex.: "/project/commands/cmd_hello.c", etc.)
- Added a CLI command to demonstrate how to draw to the ILI9325 TFT LCD
- Added a CLI command to show the contents of any directory from the SD card 
  (/project/commmands/cmd_sd_dir.c)
- Added a CLI command showing how to enter deep-sleep and exit with a SW
  wakeup (/project/commands/cmd_deepsleep.c).  Please note that the wakeup
  will not work if you are using USB for the CLI.  To see the wakeup message,
  you must use UART for the CLI, which is selected by uncommenting
  CFG_PRINTF_UART in projectconfig.h
- Fixed pmu.c to set the core clock back to an appropriate state after wakeup
- Added simple wrapper for eeprom access (projects/eeprom.c)
- Reorganised drivers/lcd to take into account non TFT LCD displays.
- Added a preliminary (experimental) driver for 128x64 pixel ST7565-based
  bitmap LCDs (ex: Adafruit Industries - http://bit.ly/9xj5vw) ... based on a
  driver from Limor Fried at Adafruit
- Numerous bug fixes added by Roel Verdult (Linux compatibility, GCC warnings, etc.)
- Added stub files for PN532 driver (/drivers/nfc/pn532), and added CFG_PN532 to
  projectconfig.h as an option
- Added a simple pwm example using 16-bit timer 1 and p1.9 (MAT0) for the output.  PWM can be used
  to drive stepper motors, or to dim LEDs by adjusting the duty-cycle, etc.  The example can be
  found in "/core/pwm"
- Added a bi-polar stepper motor driver based on the Arduino library.  Basic position data was added
  to detece deviation from the 'Home' position and to retrieve the spindle's current angle.  See
  "drivers/motor/stepper" for more information.
- Added test firmware for the UART and USBCDC CLI (tools/testfirmware)
- Added a table to projectconfig.h to try to keep track of pin and peripherals
  usage by drivers and the included SW examples.
- Reorganised some pins used by drivers to avoid pin conflicts.
- Modified core/timer16/timer16.c to allow PWM output to be stopped after a
  certain number of pulses have been sent out.
